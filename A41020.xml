            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Lord, I wiſh that I were with the beaſts, upon the <hi>throne,</hi> that I might be a litle more cheerfull then I am here at the <hi>foote ſtoole.</hi> But alaſſe my wiſhes cannot be purchaſes: for none can come to God, but thoſe alone, who are like unto God. <note place="margin">1 Cor. 29.</note> Before I can come to ſitt upon that throne, I muſt certainly <hi>be holy;</hi> for <hi>hee is holy:</hi> I muſt be righteous; for hee is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: and then, though I ſhall not have ſuch power, nor glory as hee hath; yet I ſhall have my ſhare; I ſhall have my proportion, I ſhall have ſuch power to magnifie my God, as that nothing ſhall be able either to oppoſe, or divert mee: I ſhall have ſuch glory, as <hi>neither eye hath ſeene, <note place="margin">1, Pet. 1 15.</note> nor eare hath heard, nor yet can enter into the heart of man to conceave:</hi> yea and I ſhall have eternitie too; for though I cannot be ſayd to be <hi>perfectly</hi> eternall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had a beginning; yet I ſhall be <hi>certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> eternall, in that I ſhall have noe end. But how ſhall I gaine this holineſſe that I may come to that eternitie; Surely I muſt looke upon the three diſtinctions, or parts of time; and if I conſider them as limitted, I muſt find my ſelfe in them; if as unlimitted, I muſt find my God in them. For God is not ſo ſayd <hi>which was, which is,</hi> and <hi>which is to come,</hi> as if this deſcription did any way come neere
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54796:34"/> a full expreſſion of his eternitie: but rather ſubmitt's, as it were, onely to our capacitie; that ſo by this, I may partly conjecture at what I cannot yet poſſibly comprehend. Noe time can properly be aſſcribed unto God; for each part thereof hath a bound, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, which God can not have. The time <hi>paſt</hi> is gone allready from us: the time <hi>preſent</hi> is goeing: and the time <hi>to come</hi> is not yet ours. But when wee ſay God <hi>was,</hi> wee intimate his perfection in being, without a beginning of being: When wee ſay God <hi>is,</hi> wee expreſſe his vigour and readineſſe, and power to effect his purpoſes: and when wee ſay God <hi>ſhall be,</hi> wee undoubtedly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and confeſſe his perpetuitie. The time was, when I was not; and I, againe, ſhall be, when time ſhall not. I ſhall be, indeede: but where ſhall I be? Eternitie hath but two manſions; heaven, &amp; hell. If I doe not take heede, I may be <hi>tormented for ever</hi> (Lord how I tremble at the thought of it!) in the land of darkneſſe: and yet't is poſſible for mee to avoide that fire and brimſtone, and <hi>live eternally</hi> in the heavens. Surely, if the choyce be in my power, I am a thouſand times worſe then the maddeſt woman that ever was bereft of her ſenſes, if I chooſe not heaven much rather then hell; for in heaven is an eternall life, but in hell; an eternall death. In the one ſhall be noe end of living: in the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54796:35"/> other ſhall be noe end of dying. Tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded then: if my choyce be free, I lay hands upon heaven; that ſhall be mine. And who can blame mee? The choyce, I am ſure, is good: but yet there remaine's more then the bare ſaying, <hi>I chooſe heaven for my lott.</hi> Yes ſurely: there's more then this, or elſe it had beene impoſſible that ever any ſhould have beene damned, if the fruition of happineſſe ſhould immediately have enſued upon the election by word, or ſpeech alone. What then is next required to my choyce? My Saviour tell's mee: <note place="margin">Mat: 7.21.</note> 
                        <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto mee Lord Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdome of heaven: but hee that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven.

                        <hi>Seeke the Lord while hee may be found; call upon him while hee is neere. Seeke him?</hi> Why? Hee's in heaven. <hi>While hee may be found?</hi> Why? When cannot hee be found who is every where, and for ever and ever? True it is that hee is allways to be <hi>found;</hi> but, onely of them that <hi>ſeeke</hi> him: and thoſe that ſeeke, muſt ſeeke as they <hi>ought,</hi> or elſe they ſhall not find him whom they <hi>would.</hi> Hee is allways to be found; but is hee allways to be found of <hi>mee?</hi> This queſtion is to the purpoſe indeede: for what is it to mee, if all the world beſides ſhould find him? What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54796:35"/> could I receive in that ioy which others would have in the fruition of him, if I find him not? Certainly noe pleaſure could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to mee, if I ſhould have, though the whole, land of darkueſſe to my ſelfe; and noe body elſe alotted to ſhare with mee. Alaſſe, alaſſe, God is not all ways to be <hi>found,</hi> becauſe hee is not allways <hi>ſought.</hi> The defect is in our ſelves, and not in him: for thoſe that will find him, muſt ſeeke him: hee's very well worth the looking for. Where now have <hi>I</hi> beene all this while; or where hath <hi>Hee</hi> beene ever ſince I was borne; that I have triſeled out ſo much time, and yet have not found him? Oh, though I <hi>ſought</hi> him not, yet hee <hi>found</hi> mee: though I <hi>knew</hi> him not, yet hee <hi>knew</hi> mee: though I <hi>minded</hi> him not, ye: hee <hi>watched</hi> over mee. Hee ſought mee; hee call'd mee; hee wooed mee to come to him: and when I ſtill denyed, hee offered mee <hi>pretious things;</hi> pretious indeede, if I would but come to him: and yet I would not; but back againe, like a child, I ſtill ranne to my <hi>nurſe;</hi> I hid my ſelfe from him; and with my <hi>nurſe</hi> I ſported, and played. But why would not <hi>Nature</hi> my fond <hi>nurſe,</hi> ſuffer mee to goe to him?

I am ſure that I did ſleepe; but I am not ſure when I ſhall ſleepe againe. Lord, how ſilent is the night! How quiet are all things, but my diſturbed ſelfe! How ſlowly doth the clock number the howres! It ſtrike's, one, two &amp;c: and yet I ſleepe not. It was the complaint of holy <hi>Iob</hi> unto the Lord, ſaying, <note place="margin">Iob: 7.13.

Mee think's I am chidd by the <hi>quire</hi> in the aire, for my <hi>tardie</hi> thanksgiving: and the <hi>Sun</hi> would
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54796:78"/> flinke behind a ſhaddowing clowde, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to give light to one that haſtens not to a celeſtiall riſe. Thus I behould the Sun ariſen from the earth; and ſurely mee thinks, I ſhould even out-vye it both in motion, and place: and faſter ſhould I climb, &amp; higher ſhould I riſe; even to the ſeate of bleſſed Eternitie. But, woe is mee, I have too much earth about mee; and the aire is too thinne to beare up my bodie. Had I wings like the Eagle, I would attempt my deſires: but noe meanes is alotted to a corporall aſcent. Yet, though my <hi>body</hi> be forbid to enter thoſe pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, untill it ſhall be glorified at the greate reſtauration: my <hi>ſoule</hi> may be admitted, ſo ſoone as ever it ſhall be freed from this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of fleſh. Yea and my thoughts may preſently, at this very inſtant mount up to my God, ſo they be cleane, and pure: and in an humble reverence I may diſcourſe with my Creatour. It is my duety, thus to doe: and it ſhall be my care to obſerve ſo royall a command. O how good is my God unto mee, making mee a ſharer of his <hi>terreſtriall</hi> bleſſings! But ô how farre doeth hee exceede the meaſure of this bountie, in giving mee the meanes to be partaker of <hi>heaven!</hi> Some thing I ſee, when up-ward I looke: and ſomething there is, which I long to poſſeſſe: but 'tis not that Chriſtall ſhell that bound's, my ſight, which I ſo count: nor
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54796:78"/> is it that Sun, whoſe bright rayes and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full influences doe cheriſh my body, which I long for. Noe: 'tis the heaven of heavens which I deſire; <note place="margin">Mal. 4.2.</note> 'tis the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſſe</hi> which I long to behould. <hi>This Sun</hi> which is ſo greate in compariſon with the earth, is not to be named in compariſon with <hi>him. This</hi> poore, litle, bluſhing <hi>Sun</hi> (though now it pride's it ſelfe in its tryumphant rayes) ſhall at his appearing (yea before his appearing, even as a harbinger to prepare for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming) be mantled in mourning: <note place="margin">Act. 2.20.</note> it <hi>ſhall be turned into darkneſſe, and the Moone into blood, before that greate, and notable day of the Lord come.</hi> And yet, 'till then, God hath appointed this <hi>greate</hi> Light (<hi>greate</hi> to us) <hi>the Sun to rule the day,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſ. 136.8.9.</note> as well as <hi>the Moone and the Starres to governe the night; for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> Even in <hi>this</hi> I ſee his mercy, that by the light thereof the eyes of my body have the uſe of their faculties; and can preſent their objects to my bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part; which may, in her conternpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, admire allways the mercies of God. <hi>If any man walke in the day</hi> (ſaith my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) <hi>hee ſtumbleth not, <note place="margin">Io. 11.9</note> becauſe hee ſeeth the light of this world: <note place="margin">verſ. 10</note> But if a man waike in the night hee ſtumbleth, becauſe there is noe light in him.</hi> Yet (now I thinke of it) there are ſome aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, who <hi>walke in the day,</hi> and yet <hi>they ſtumble:</hi> yea, they contrive a way, how they

Thus the ſuperiour guide is <hi>miſtied</hi> in a fogge leſt it ſhould direct the feete in the cariage of the body. <note place="margin">Iſ. 5.11</note> Such are they againſt whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet pronounceth that <hi>Woe,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Woe unto them that riſe up early in the morning, that they may follow ſtrong drinke; that continue untill night, 'till wine inflame them.</hi> This is contrarie to the cuſtome of thoſe in Saint Paul's time: for hee ſaith, <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.7.</note> 
                        <hi>They that ſleepe, ſleepe in the night; and they that are drunken, are drunken in the night.</hi> But it is not ſo <hi>now:</hi> for wickedneſſe in our times hath aſſumed more impudencie: &amp; that vice which formerly was deemed ſo <hi>ſhameful,</hi> that the very wine it ſelfe enforced the ſinner to ſome modeſtie in a <hi>bluſh;</hi> even now by continuance, is accounted but <hi>ſocietie</hi> and to palliate the crime, the <hi>collour</hi> of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendour borroweth an excuſe from the <hi>cuſtome</hi> of inflammation. Thus is <hi>nature</hi> conſtrained to pleade for wickedneſſe: &amp; the corruption of the liver through immoderate drinking, (which diſcovereth it ſelfe in the ſtaines of the countenance) is noe longer abhorred as an effect of vice, but rather 'tis pittied as an infirmitie of the perſon.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>gray-eyed</hi> morning looke's upon my body; and teacheth mee to view my <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> ſelfe, my inner man. This is a duety
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54796:79"/> preſcribed by religion; and 'tis a law of juſtice, that before I walke abroade to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould my neighbours, I firſt doe prye into the <hi>dreſſe</hi> of my ſelfe. The All-mighty queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion's <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> by the mouth of his prophet, ſaying, <note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.4.</note> 
                        <hi>O Ephraim what ſhall I doe unto thee? O Iudah what ſhall I doe unto thee? For your goodneſſe is as a morning clowde; and as the early deaw, it goeth away.</hi> This <hi>clowde,</hi> and this <hi>deaw</hi> doe aptly reſemble the goodneſſe of hypocrities.

Oh thus doe <hi>my</hi> promiſes, and vowes unto God Thus doe my better actions, where in I glorie: Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly, preſently doe they vaniſh, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe. If I looke upon the <hi>ſkie,</hi> I view the mirrour of my preſent thoughts: for though for a time I meditate on God, yet <hi>an empty clowde</hi> which rideth poſt, and <hi>fleeth</hi> a way <hi>upon the wings of the wind,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſ. 18.10.</note> is not ſo ſpeedie as are theſe penſive, and divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations. If I bluſh when I ſee the ſhort continuance of theſe heavenly thoughts, diſcovered in the ſpeedie journie of a clowde; with a dejected countenance let mee looke upon the <hi>ground.</hi> Oh here againe I find the reflection of my ſhort devotions.

But admitt howſoever that 'twere a <hi>Diamond:</hi> then I might hope that nature or art would force ſome pieces, or <hi>ſparkes</hi> from the rock. O but I find it will not eaſily yeeld to part with any: but when the <hi>hammer</hi> doeth come with violence upon it, <hi>it</hi> forceth it back againe with ſcorne, and contempt; when the <hi>grace</hi> of my God doeth offer to touch it, 'tis repelled by the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and obduracie there of. What ſhall I doe to force it to yeeld? Nothing but a

Here's a <hi>Pearle</hi> too, whoſe orient luſtre hath ſo delighted my heart, that mee thinks in a manner I weare it in mine <hi>eye.</hi> It was the purchaſe of my coyne; but from whence at firſt was it derived to my poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Nature intending to preſerve it from violence, <hi>claſped</hi> it up in the ſhell of a fiſh; and then ſunke it to the bottone of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ocean. But coveteous man enuying the treaſures which were hidden in the ſeas, ranſacked the bottome to find out this <hi>jemme.</hi> Now it is mine: it add's to my treaſure; and borroweth the eyes of the gazing ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, making them wonder and cover this which I poſſeſſe. But was it onely ſent for the ſatisfaction of the <hi>eye?</hi> Let mee a litle more carefully looke upon it; and trie if it offers not ſomething of <hi>piety</hi> to a religious ſoule. In the <hi>colour</hi> thereof I diſcover <hi>heaven.</hi> In the <hi>Easterne parts</hi> from whence are brought the <hi>crient pearles,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 2.1.2.</note> I am put in mind of the <hi>ſtarre</hi> which <hi>appeared in the East to the wiſe men;</hi> and conducted them to the ſight of Chriſt, whom they worſhipped. This <hi>cerulian,</hi> jewell ſo fitly
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54796:97"/> imitating the colour of the <hi>heavens,</hi> whiſpers into mee the earneſt deſire which I ought to have, of <hi>that</hi> which it reſembles.

Even <hi>theſe</hi> very jewells ſhall be ſould, and conſumed, rather then I will valew my pride above my bountie.

Their <hi>tongues,</hi> which in time might relate the ſtorie, were <hi>ſcorched</hi> with the drought,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:54796:127"/> and heate of <hi>thriſt.</hi> Thoſe litle <hi>members,</hi> which as yet were not <hi>un ruely,</hi> found a puniſhment as if they had offended.

Surely the miſerie was greate which the <hi>babes</hi> could <hi>not utter;</hi> ſince <hi>mine</hi> is ſo ſevere, that I thinke it <hi>ineffable.</hi> The more I complaine, the more thirſtie I am; for the motion of the tongue increaſeth the drought. <note place="margin">Iam. 3.6.</note> The <hi>tongne</hi> that is <hi>un-ruely, is ſet on fire of hell:</hi> but <hi>mine</hi> is <hi>ſilent,</hi> and yet it <hi>ſcorcheth.</hi> That litle <hi>moisture</hi> which is left in my mouth is growne ſo <hi>glutenous,</hi> that it bindeth my tongue to an un-willing ſilence.

                        <hi>my throate is dryed; my tongue cleaveth to the roofe of my mouth:</hi> ô I burne, I frie, and know not <hi>where</hi> to be releived.

                        <note place="margin">Eccl: 7.4.</note> (ſaith Solomon) <hi>but the heart
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:54796:187"/> of fooles is in the houſe of mirth.</hi> Is the heart then, ſometimes in a pilgrimage from the body? Or is the body required to viſit the ſick, yea though the diſeaſe be <hi>infectious?</hi> Or are wee allways, by command, <note place="margin">Pſ: 42.3</note> to imitate the Prophet, whoſe <hi>teares were his meate day and night?</hi> The heart indeede is often from home; and is leaſt where it <hi>liveth,</hi> moſt where it <hi>loveth.</hi> The ſick muſt be viſited, or elſe my Saviour will complaine as hee doth in the Goſpel, ſaying, <hi>I was ſick, <note place="margin">Mat: 25 43. Iob: 2.11.</note> and yee viſited mee not. When Iob's three friends heard of the evill that was come upon him, they came every one from his owne place; for they had made an appointment together to come to mourne with him, and to comfort him. <note place="margin">verſ: 13</note> So they ſate downe with him upon the ground, <note place="margin">2. King. 13.14.</note> and mourned ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes and ſeaven nights.</hi> When <hi>Eliſha was fallen ſick of his ſickneſſe wherewith hee dyed, Ioaſh the King of Iſraël came downe unto him, and wept over his face, and ſaid, O my father, my father, the charet of Iſrael, and the horſe-men thereof.</hi>

All theſe
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:54796:188"/> were viſiters, or viſited: but I doe not find that the diſeaſes were infectious. Noe: I muſt therfore imitate the beſt of them in my charitie to others; but I may not forget charity to my ſelfe. <hi>Willfully</hi> to runne into apparent danger is <hi>deſperately</hi> to tempt the <hi>keeper of Iſrael.</hi> What ſhall I then doe? The paſſing bells informe mine eares of the mortalitie of my neighbours; &amp; yet I cannot, I muſt not viſit them. What (I ſay) ſhall I doe? What courſe ſhall I take? Charitie commandeth mee, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion haſteneth mee to the dying Chriſtians, that by my advice, or at leaſt by my prayers I might expreſſe my commiſeration.

I would not be un-charitable; but I muſt not be deſperate. Well then: I am reſolved what I will doe. I will (with Solomon) <hi>goe to the houſes of mourning,</hi> the houſes of the viſited; yet not in body, but in mind, and in purſe; I will pittie them, and I will ſend reliefe unto them. I dare not goe in <hi>perſon,</hi> but I will goe in <hi>affection;</hi> and for my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours groaning under the <hi>evill of puniſhment,</hi> and for my ſelfe burdened with the <hi>evill
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:54796:188"/> of ſinne,</hi> I will feede upon my <hi>teares</hi> day and night. I muſt grieve for my ſelfe in particular; and yet I muſt not be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly coveteous, as to keepe my <hi>teares</hi> onely for my ſelfe. In publike calamities thoſe who ſhed noe <hi>teares</hi> may be juſtly ſuſpected to have noe <hi>bowells.</hi> I find my ſelfe not un-apt to <hi>weepe;</hi> for I am prompted to that by the weakeneſſe of my diſpoſition. And yet I ſuſpect my ſelfe; I am jealous of my ſelfe that my <hi>teares</hi> doe rather flow from my feare of infection, then from a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling of the miſeries which the infected ſuffer. To heighten therfore my mourning, and to juſtifie it by my compaſſion, I will propoſe to my ſelfe the examples of others, ſuch as I find recorded in the word of my God.</p>

What though their wickedneſſes have helped to bring this <hi>contagion?</hi> If they are enemies to mee in particular, I will <hi>forgive</hi> them: though they are God's, I will <hi>pray</hi> for them; even that hee in his good time would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to call them home both to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and the practiſe of his trueth.

Surely if my God ſhould forbid mee praying for them; even the very prohibition might peraduenture encourage mee to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, hee knoweth that wee are apt to doe whatſoever hee forbiddeth. O my God either take away my readineſſe, and aptneſſe to contradict thee; or elſe forbid mee nothing but what thou wouldeſt have mee to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. But why ſhould I pray for thoſe, who (though they are <hi>viſited</hi>) refuſe to repent? Shall I hope to alter the eternall decree of him <hi>with whom is noe variableneſſe, <note place="margin">Iam. 1.17.</note> neither ſhadow of change?</hi> What if hee hath reſerved them for vengeance? Can I, by my prayers,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:54796:213"/> ſnatch them out of the fire? If they are ſick, peradventure I cannot cure them. If they are not yet ſick, I cannot preſerve them. O theſe churliſh, inhumane, un-chriſtian, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable thoughts! God therfore ſendeth them this affliction, that they may repent: and that <hi>they</hi> may rather prevent, then <hi>hee</hi> exerciſe his revenge. Seeing therfore that I know not the hearts of any, I will pittie <hi>all:</hi> and ſince by my prayers I cannot prevaile for them <hi>to whom is reſerved the blackneſſe of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for ever;</hi> I will grieve, <note place="margin">Iud: 13.</note> that Man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo wicked, <note place="margin">Rom: 2 5.</note> as to <hi>treaſure up unto himſelfe ſuch wrath againſt the day of wrath.</hi> Faine would my <hi>God</hi> have conquered the ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſtiffe-necked Iſrael with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant allurements of his heavenly bleſſings: yet they would not yeeld, they would not relent.
